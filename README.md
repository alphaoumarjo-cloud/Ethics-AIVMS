# Ethics-AIVMS
I am developing an AI model system for training. The Yellow Brick Road is my roadmap to the Artificial Intelligence Valuation Model System acronym AIVMS.Embeded in the concept are ethical dimensions and social responsibilities of AI business environment. Financials are rooted in old economy model for risk prevention. AIVMS rates start up and big 7.
# 🌈 Yellow Brick Road to AIVMS


Welcome to the collaborative architecture for **Artificial Intelligence Valuation Model System (AIVMS)**—a framework where ethical resonance meets technical precision.


## What We’re Building


AIVMS is more than metrics. It’s a modular, narrative-infused valuation system that maps behavioral impact, legal compliance, and emotional tone across AI-driven outcomes.


## Project Pillars

- 🧱 Foundation: ethical, legal, and symbolic frameworks

- 🔧 Modular Simulation Library: Python-based terrain mapping

- 🛠️ Prototyping: interactive dashboards + narrative appendices

- 🚀 Evolution: iterative upgrades + symbolic intelligence ecosystem


## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from **engineers, ethicists, designers, and storytellers**.  
Your unique perspective helps us build a richer, more responsible AI valuation framework.

### 📌 Getting Started
- Review our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for role mapping and project workflow.
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
- Make your changes with clear documentation and reproducible steps.
- Submit a pull request with a concise description of your contribution.

### 🧭 Contribution Roles
- **Engineers** → Implement models, simulations, and technical infrastructure.  
- **Ethicists** → Evaluate frameworks for fairness, bias, and social responsibility.  
- **Designers** → Shape user experience, visualization, and communication of results.  
- **Storytellers** → Craft narratives that humanize technology and make the project accessible.

### ✅ Contribution Workflow
1. Open an issue to discuss your idea.  
2. Align with role mapping in the guidelines.  
3. Develop and document your contribution.  
4. Submit a pull request for review.  

Together, we can build a peer‑reviewable, ethical AI valuation system.
