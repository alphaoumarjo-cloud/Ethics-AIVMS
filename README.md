# Ethics-AIVMS
I am developing an AI model system for training. The Yellow Brick Road is my roadmap to the Artificial Intelligence Valuation Model System acronym AIVMS.Embeded in the concept are ethical dimensions and social responsibilities of AI business environment. Financials are rooted in old economy model for risk prevention. AIVMS rates start up and big 7.
# 🌈 Yellow Brick Road to AIVMS


Welcome to the collaborative architecture for **Artificial Intelligence Valuation Model System (AIVMS)**—a framework where ethical resonance meets technical precision.


## What We’re Building


AIVMS is more than metrics. It’s a modular, narrative-infused valuation system that maps behavioral impact, legal compliance, and emotional tone across AI-driven outcomes.


## Project Pillars

- 🧱 Foundation: ethical, legal, and symbolic frameworks

- 🔧 Modular Simulation Library: Python-based terrain mapping

- 🛠️ Prototyping: interactive dashboards + narrative appendices

- 🚀 Evolution: iterative upgrades + symbolic intelligence ecosystem


## How to Contribute


We welcome engineers, ethicists, designers, and storytellers. See [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for role mapping and project workflow.
